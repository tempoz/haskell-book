# haskell-book

The purpose of this repository is to record my experiences
learning haskell from the reputedly-excellent book "Haskell
Programming from First Principles". It is meant as a way both
to track my progress as well as a place to store all code I
produce while working through the book for my later reference.
It is also a place to keep helpful notes. It is not meant as
a learning guide for anyone else; for that, I recommend you
also consult the aforementioned book "Haskell Programming
from First Principles" by Chris Allen and Julie Moronuki.
